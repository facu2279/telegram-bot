# Telegram-bot

## General

This bot lets you know the weather in more than 200,000 cities and it also has a counter.

I did it to learn how to make bots in telegram.

The code is 100% main.py file, the rest of the files are from the virtual environment used to install the different modules.

I'm not going to have it online for long but you can find it as @weather_nerv_bot in your telegram search engine.
